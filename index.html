        <p>A condition marked by impaired muscle coordination (spastic paralysis) and/or other disabilities, 
            typically caused by damage to the brain before or at birth.
        </p>
        <p>A congenital disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture.
            Cerebral palsy is due to abnormal brain development, often before birth.
            Symptoms include exaggerated reflexes, floppy or rigid limbs and involuntary motions. These appear by early childhood.
            Long-term treatment includes physical and other therapies, drugs and sometimes surgery.
        </p> 
        <p>With all the different issues that cerebral palsy brings it make living harder than it needs to be. 
            When your living with cerebral palsy you learn to adapt and learn to do day to day things with the symptoms that it brings.
