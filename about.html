        <h1>WHAT IS CEREBRAL PALSY</h1>
        <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. 
            CP is the most common motor disability in childhood. Cerebral means having to do with the brain. 
            Palsy means weakness or problems with using the muscles. CP is caused by abnormal brain development 
            or damage to the developing brain that affects a person’s ability to control his or her muscles.

            The symptoms of CP vary from person to person.
             A person with severe CP might need to use special equipment to be able to walk,  
            or might not be able to walk at all and might need lifelong care. A person with mild CP, 
            on the other hand, might walk a little awkwardly, but might not need any special help.
             CP does not get worse over time, though the exact symptoms can change over a person’s lifetime.
            
            All people with CP have problems with movement and posture.
             Many also have related conditions such as intellectual disability; 
             seizures; problems with vision, hearing, or speech; changes in the spine (such as scoliosis); 
             or joint problems (such as contractures).
        </p>
        <h2>TYPES OF CEREBRAL PALSY</h2>
        <p>Doctors classify CP according to the main type of movement disorder involved. 
            Depending on which areas of the brain are affected
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stiff muscles (spasticity)</li>
            <li>Uncontrollable movements (dyskinesia)</li>
            <li>Poor balance and coordination (ataxia)</li>
        </ul>
